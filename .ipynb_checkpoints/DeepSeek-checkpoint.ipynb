    "### **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "This notebook is designed to demonstrate how to run the **distilled versions of the DeepSeek R1 Reasoning model family**. These models are optimized for structured thinking and reasoning tasks and are lightweight enough to run on a single Intel Max Series 1100 GPU with 48 GB of VRAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Highlights\n",
    "1. **Distilled Models**: Focused versions of DeepSeek R1 for better performance on limited hardware.\n",
    "2. **Interactive Mode**: Engage directly with the models through a simple interface.\n",
    "3. **Device Agnostic**: Automatically selects GPU (`xpu`) or CPU based on availability.\n",
